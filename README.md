# **the wisard-overlay**
This overlay contains ebuilds that I personally maintain or copied from other overlays with minor changes.

### **How to use this overlay?**
Since I don't have the overlay listed under the [gentoo overlays](https://repos.gentoo.org/), you have to manually add it in your repos.conf.
